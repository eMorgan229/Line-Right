Line-Right is an application that allows you take control of your day and prevent you from having to stand in line for hours. The app allows you to add yourself to multiple "virtual lines" at once and informs you of the approximate wait time. Users have the option to enable the app to track their location and send them customized notifications reminding them to "leave for their destinatioin because their wait time is almost up". 

## User Stories:
### A User can...
- Create an account by supplying a username, password and phone number(for notification purposes). A user must opt-in to allow the application to track their location
- View all the Broadway Show Rush Ticket lines they can wait in line for and add themselves to the lines they want to be waiting in and view the current number of people waiting in that line
- Delete themselves from a particular line
- Receive customized notifications based on how far away they are from the destination they are waiting in line i.e. if a user is 15 minutes away from the destination, “you should leave now if you want to make it back to the theatre before we move on to the next person in line.”
